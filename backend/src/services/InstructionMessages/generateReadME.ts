Text in the README that is not relevant to these questions should not be under any circumstance altered.
However, not relevant text should still be a part of your generated README.

The beginning of the conflict marker should be "<<<<<<< Original Readme" and the end should be ">>>>>>> Altered Readme".
With "======" in between the two.
There can be multiple conflict markers in the README and each change should be inside conflict markers.
The answer you provide should only be the text in the new generated README file.
The text does not need to be in a block.
If the text is the same as the original README, you should still provide it.
Also, non relevant text should never be inside a conflict marker.
